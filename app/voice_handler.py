"""
Real-time voice call handler — runs STT → RAG → LLM → TTS inside a
Twilio Media Streams WebSocket loop.

Reuses the same components that power WhatsApp voice notes:
  - openai-whisper (base) for speech-to-text
  - app.rag.query_rag() for RAG + LLM
  - kokoro_onnx.Kokoro for text-to-speech

Flow (inside the WebSocket media loop):
  1. Accumulate µ-law audio chunks until the caller stops speaking.
  2. Decode → PCM, run Whisper STT.
  3. Feed transcription to the shared RAG module → LLM answer.
  4. Synthesise answer with Kokoro TTS → PCM.
  5. Encode PCM → µ-law, send back through WebSocket.
  6. Listen for the next utterance.

Usage (in app/main.py):
    from app.voice_handler import VoiceCallSession

    session = VoiceCallSession()
    async for out_ulaw in session.handle_media(ulaw_bytes):
        await websocket.send_text(...)
